## Description

This is an application to help flatmates work out what a fair share of the rent is. It asks a user to enter the price of the whole property, then an estimate of what they think the value of the common areas is as a percentage of the total rent. Below that it asks for the dimentions of each room and how many people are gonna share that room. Every flatmate pays an equal share on the percentage allocated to the common areas while on the remaining rent they pay proportionately according to the size of their room
